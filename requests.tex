\section{Requests}

\subsection{Neutrino beam}
The experiment can run parasitically with T2K, therefore we request no dedicated beam time nor beam condition.
% As data taking periods, we request the `nominal' T2K one-year operation both for the neutrino beam and the antineutrino beam.
T2K has been requesting
% The T2K has been requesting 
$9\times10^{20}$~POT/year and actually accumulating about $7\times10^{20}$~POT/year in recent years.
For each year, starting from the Autumn,  T2K is running predominantly in the neutrino mode or in the antineutrino mode.
Our request is to have one-year neutrino-mode data and another one-year antineutrino mode data
assuming that the POT for the fast extraction in each year is more than $5\times10^{20}$~POT.

\subsection{Equipment request including power line}
We request the following
% We request the followings 
in terms of equipment on the B2 floor:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Site for the WAGASCI modules, Side-MRD modules and BabyMIND and their electronics system on the B2 floor of the near detector hall (Figure \ref{fig:all_detector_topview} and \ref{fig:location}).}
\item {Anchor points (holes) on the B2 floor to secure the WAGASCI modules, Side-MRD module and Baby-MIND. Detailed floor plans to be communicated in a separate document.}
\item {Power line for the magnets in Baby-MIND: 400 V tri-phase 48-to-62 Hz, capable of delivering 12 kW. 
We request the magnet power line
% We have a wish for the magnet power line 
to be installed and available to us by beginning of March 2018.}
\item Electricity for electronics and 
% water circulation system, 3 kW, standard Japanese electrical sockets.
water circulation system. We request a total of 3 kW of power in standard Japanese electrical sockets for the following items:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Online PCs: 2.1 kW
		\item Electronics: 0.7 kW
		\item Water sensors: 1 kW
	\end{enumerate}
\item Air conditioner for cooling heat generation at Baby-MIND magnets, online PCs and electronics
\item Beam timing signal and spill information
\item Network connection
\end{itemize}

The infrastructure for much of the above exists already.
Exceptions are the power line for the magnet and the electronics and holes in the B2 floor to anchor the detector support structures.

After this WAGASCI experiment, Baby MIND and Side-MRD's will remain if approved by J-PARC, and be used as common platforms of future neutrino experiments using the J-PARC neutrino beam.
