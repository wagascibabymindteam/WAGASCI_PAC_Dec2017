\section{Requests}

\subsection{Neutrino beam}
The experiment can run parasitically with T2K, therefore we request no dedicated beam time nor beam condition.
We request \textcolor{red}{$1 \times 10^{21}$ POT neutrino beam data and another $1 \times 10^{21}$ POT antineutrino data}.

\subsection{Equipment request including power line}
We request the followings in terms of equipment on the B2 floor:
\begin{itemize}
\item Site for the WAGASCI modules, Side-MRD modules and BabyMIND and their electronics system on the B2 floor of the near detector hall (Fig. \ref{fig:location}).
\item Anchor points (holes) on the B2 floor to secure the WAGASCI modules, Side-MRD module and Baby-MIND (Fig. \ref{fig:floor_plan})
\item Power line for the magnets in Baby-MIND: 400 V tri-phase 48-to-62 Hz, capable of delivering 12 kW.
\item Electricity for electronics and water circulation system, 3 kW, standard Japanese electrical sockets.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Online PCs: 2.1 kW
		\item Electronics: 0.7 kW
		\item Water sensors: ?
	\end{enumerate}
\item Air conditioner for cooling heat generation at Baby-MIND magnets, online PCs and electoronics
\item Beam timing signal and spill information
\item Network connection
\end{itemize}
