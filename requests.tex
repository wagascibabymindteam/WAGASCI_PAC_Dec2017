\section{Requests}
\subsection{Beam condition and beam time}
The experiment can run parasitically with T2K, therefore we request no dedicated beam time nor beam condition.
We request \textcolor{red}{$1 \times 10^{21}$ POT neutrino beam data and another $1 \times 10^{21}$ POT antineutrino data}.
% Assuming 250kW beam operation, it corresponds to $\sim$ 100 days of data taking.

\subsection{Request of equipment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Site in the B2 floor of the near detector hall (Fig. \ref{fig:location})
\item Electricity \textcolor{red}{($\sim$10kW)} for the electronics and water circulation system
\item Beam timing signal and spill information
\item Network connection
\end{itemize}
