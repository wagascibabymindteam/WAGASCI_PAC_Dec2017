\subsection{Standalone WAGASCI-module tracking performance}
\label{sec:mc_study_standalone}

The previous section has described the inclusive charged-current event selection using the Muon Range detectors.
A muon is identified by requiring one track to penetrate multiple planes of the MRD's.
For the WAGASCI configuration described in Sec.~\ref{sec:mc_setup}, only $7\%$ of the muons are stopped in one of the WAGASCI modules. 
This proportion increases to $53\%$ for pions and $73\%$ for protons produced by neutrino interactions.% at $1.5^{\circ}$ off-axis. 
Figure~\ref{fig:stoppedproportions} shows the momentum distribution of these daughter particles as well as for the sub-sample stopped in one of the WAGASCI modules. 
For the measurement of the neutrino interaction final states, tracks of charged pions, protons and  low-momentum ($p_{\mu} < 300~$MeV/c) muons have to be reconstructed by the WAGASCI module.
Therefore, the standalone tracking abilities of the WAGASCI module, especially momentum threshold,  is important for the exclusive interaction measurements.

Here we present the result of the study based on an original study done for the T2K ND280 upgrade with some modifications.
Though the cell size is similar to the WAGASCI configuration, the external dimensions are different (1864 mm $\times$ 600 mm $\times$ 1300 mm).
We present the results which are less affected by the difference of the external dimensions.
%Whenever the results are presented with this external size and this parameter is likely to impact the result, it will be mentioned.\\

A simplified criteria , but representing conditions for the WAGASCI module tracking, are applied to evaluate the reconstruction performance of the WAGASCI module. 
The fiducial volume is chosen as the inner cube of the module which surfaces are  4 Ã— scintillator space = 100 mm distant from the module external surfaces.
%The neutrino interactions are simulated using NEUT v5.3.2. The NEUT input neutrino flux is estimated using JnuBeam v13a and assuming the detector to be located at $1.5^{\circ}$ off-axis, as in Section~\ref{sec:mc_study}.
%Note that the event reconstruction efficiency as a function of true neutrino energy might be changed at 1.5$^{\circ}$, due for example to different $Q^{2}$ distributions. For this reason, one has to note that the reconstruction results might change slightly from  $2.5^{\circ}$ and $1.5^{\circ}$. To avoid a similar change on the particle-only reconstruction efficiencies, they will be presented as a function of variables that completely characterize the particle kinematic state, \textit{i.e.} its momentum and angle.
%Figure~\ref{fig:trueinteraction_particle} shows  the vertices distributions the vertex distributions of the daughter particles of neutrinos interacting one standard WAGASCI water-module.
%In this section, we will show the detector reconstruction and particle identification in this phase space, both for leptonic and hadronic particles.
%We will finally show an empty WAGASCI module can highly enhance the ability to constrain the neutrino interaction final state which is critical to reduce the corresponding uncertainties.

%\subsection{Reconstruction algorithm}
%\label{Sec:Reco}
%\subsubsection{Description}
%For this section, an ideal ``simulated'' reconstruction is developed.
A track is reconstructed if:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The particle is charged.
%\item Has at least one hit (energy deposit $> 2.5$ photo-electron) in a scintillator.\\
%\item The particle enters one TCP and has one hit in the tracker.\\
%  Or\\
\begin{itemize}
\item The track is long enough and has at least 2 hits in both of two views (XZ, YZ).
  In the pure longitudinal or transverse going tracks, it corresponds to the track length of $100~$mm.
\item The track shall not be superimposed with longer tracks in both of two views. The superposition criterion is estimated with the distance inter-tracks (DIT) which corresponds to the orthogonal distance between two tracks at the ending point of the shortest one (see Figure~\ref{fig:DIT}). 
%For a track we call track 1, the super position criterion is tested with every longer track that
% every longer tracks that 
%starts at the same vertex. Let $\vec{p_{1}}$ the vector of track 1, and $p_{1}^{a}$ its projections in the XZ, YZ and XY planes respectively for i=1,2,3. Note that these are 
%projections onto 2D planes and not onto a direction vector.
% projections in a 2D planes and not on a direction vector. 
%this case, the relative angle between track 1 and a longer track, track 2, (of vector 
% In this case, the relative angle between the track 1 and a longer track 2 (of vector 
%$\vec{p_{2}}$) in a view a is given by:
%\begin{equation}
%  \cos \theta = \frac{\vec{p_{1}^{a}} \cdot \vec{p_{2}^{a}}}{||\vec{p_{1}^{a}}|| ||\vec{p_{2}^{a}}||} 
%\end{equation}
%and the distance inter track is given by:
%\begin{equation}
%  \text{DIT} = ||\vec{p_{1}^{a}}|| \sin \theta
%\end{equation}
The DIT should be higher than $4 \times \text{scintillator width}$ (=100~mm) for the shorter track not to be superimposed with the longer track.
\end{itemize} 
%\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Expected performance of the water-in WAGASCI module}
\label{sec:mc_waterin}
Figures~\ref{fig:efficiency_particle} shows the expected track reconstruction efficiency obtained with the criteria above.
Table~\ref{tab:reconstructedparticles} summarizes the reconstruction efficiencies and the reconstruction momentum thresholds.
This threshold is defined as the momentum under which the reconstruction efficiency falls under $30\%$.
The thresholds for muon and pion are $150~$MeV/c. %Most of the muons are above this threshold (see Figure~\ref{fig:trueinteraction_particle}) which leads to a $79\%$ reconstruction efficiency. 
\begin{table}[htbp]
% \small
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\label{tab:reconstructedparticles} Reconstruction efficiency and momentum threshold for muons, pions and protons.

    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
      \hline
      & $\mu$ & $\pi$ & p \\
      \hline
      Reconstruction Efficiency & 79\% & 52\% & 26\% \\\hline
%      Purity & 56\% & 14\% & 31\% \\
      Momentum threshold & 150 MeV/c & 150 MeV/c & 550 MeV/c \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
The lower pion and proton efficiencies (respectively $52\%$ and $26\%$) are due to lower momentum and also due to the secondary interaction.
Efficiencies of each particle type tend to decrease in the backward region due to lower particle momenta.
However, for a fixed momentum value, the reconstruction efficiency do not strongly depend on the angle thanks to the WAGASCI cuboid lattice.

%The reconstruction is thereafter tested on neutrino events. Table~\ref{tab:reconstructedinteractions} summarizes the number of reconstructed events and efficiencies for each interaction type. As expected from the high muon reconstruction efficiency, the charged current interactions have reconstruction efficiencies $\geq 85\%$.

%Note that a Particle Identification Algorithm has been also developed. It is based on the charge deposition of the particles in the scintillator, of the detection of a decay-electron. 
%However, information depends highly on the number of scintillator hits by a particle,
% this information highly depends on the number of scintillator hit by a particle, 
%which creates an important difference between a real WAGASCI module and the one used for the ND280-upgrade simulation. For this reason, the corresponding results will not be detailed here, but can be found in~\cite{ND280Upgrade}.

\subsubsection{Expected performance of the water-out WAGASCI module}
One experimental option is to remove water from one of the two WAGASCI modules.
%In the nominal configuration, $20\%$ of the neutrino interactions occurs on scintillators (C$_{8}$H$_{8}$).
%This background should be removed in order to measure the neutrino interaction on the same target as Super-K, which suppress the differences in cross-section models.
%For this purpose, we propose to use a water-out module, where the water is replaced by air.
The detector is fully active and has a $3~$mm spatial resolution (scintillator thickness) which create and ideal detector to reconstruct and identify hadrons, and study 2p2h interaction.
%The counter-part is the difference in particle energy deposition between the water and this water-out module that will need to be corrected for.
%In this section, we present the capabilities of such a module, and the impact it can have on cross-section measurements for the neutrino community in genral and T2K in particular.\\
The same reconstruction criteria as in Sec.~\ref{sec:mc_waterin} are applied for the water-out module.
Figure~\ref{fig:reconstructionefficiencyparticle_mometum} shows the comparison between the water-in and the water-out reconstruction efficiencies for muon, pions and protons.
$90\%$ of the muons and $87\%$ of the pions are reconstructed, while $70\%$ of the protons are even reconstructed.
It allows to low down the proton threshold to 250~MeV/c (see Table~\ref{tab:reconstructedparticles_empty}).

%As a consequence of tracking even low momenta particle, the reconstruction efficiency is uniform and almost maximal on the entire $\cos \theta_{\mu}$ phase space, as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:efficiency_muonkinematics_empty}.
%Since the fiducial mass represents 0.25~tons, the total number of events is divided by a factor of 3 compared to the water-in module.
The water-out module offers interesting possibilities to study 2p2h interaction since $70\%$ of the protons are reconstructed.
%In the future, a possible separation as a function of the number of proton track will be studied. Morevover, we are currenly pursuing the use of single and double transverse variables (cite Xianguo) to open new possibilities for separating np-nh from Final State Interactions, or for isolating the interactions on hydrogen from interactions on carbon in this module.
