\subsection{Side muon range detector}
The dimension of the MRD in the side (downstream) region is
$\sim$200(200)cm $\times$ $\sim$300(350)cm in a plane perpendicular to the muon direction
and $\sim$75(230)cm along the muon direction.
The MRD in the side (downstream) region consists of 12(30) 3 cm thick iron plates and 14(32) tracking scintillator planes.
Muons generated at smaller angle to the beam axis have higher momentum,
so the MRD in the downstream region is thicker along the muon direction.
Each tracking scintillator layer of the MRD in the side (downstream) region
has 25(28) scintillator bars whose dimensions are 20cm x 1cm x 200(200)cm and 20cm x 1cm x 300(350)cm,
making a plane measuring 300(350)$\times$200(200)cm$^{2}$ in the horizontal and vertical directions and 2 cm along the muon direction.
The total number of channels in the MRD is 1246.
