\subsection{Side muon range detector}
Two Side-MRD modules for tracking secondary particles from neutrino interactions will be installed in 2018. 
Each Side-MRD module is composed of 11 steel plates and 80 scintillator slabs. 
The slabs are arranged as 10 layers installed in the 13 mm gaps between the
30 mm thick plates. 
Each steel plate size is 30 mm $\times$ 1610 mm $\times$ 1800 mm.
Total module size  is  2236 mm$\times$1630 mm$\times$975 mm as shown in Figure \ref{fig:side_mrd} (left), weight is $\sim$8.5 tonne. 

Scintillator bars were manufactured by Uniplast company in Vladimir, Russia. Polystyrene based scintillators were extruded with thickness of 7~mm, then cut to the size of $7\times200\times1800$ mm$^{3}$. Dopant composition is  1.5\% PTP and 0.01\% POPOP.
Scintillator surface was etched by a chemical agent to form a white diffuse layer with excellent reflective performance. 
Ideal contact between the scintillator and the reflector raises the light yield up to 50\% comparing to an uncovered scintillator. 
A sinusoidal groove was milled along the scintillator to provide uniform light collection over the whole scintillator surface. 
WLS Y11 Kuraray fiber of 1 mm diameter was glued with an optical cement EJ-500 in the S-shape groove  as shown in Figure \ref{fig:side_mrd}(right). 
A minimum bending radius of 30 mm was used to ensure the the Kuraray S-type fibers remained within specification.
Both ends of the fiber were glued into optical connectors which were themselves attached to the scintillator and provide an interface to SiPMs, Hamamatsu  MPPC S13081-050CS(X1). 

%The plastic molded connectors provide an interface to SiPMs, Hamamatsu  MPPC S13081-050CS(X1) used for the WAGASCI detector. 
%Optical coupler of this type (so-called Baby-mind type of optical connector) consists of two parts (see Fig. \ref{fig:side_mrd_optical_con}):  an container for the MPPC  and  a ferrule with the fiber.  The ferrule  is glued in the scitillator, and its end with glued in WLS fiber was polished. 
%Both parts of the optical coupler are latched by a snap-like mechanism: a locking groove inside the container and matching ring protuberance on the ferrule.
%To ensure the optical contact a foam spring made of sponge rubber presses the MPPC to the fiber end (Fig. \ref{fig:side_mrd_optical_scheme}).

Scintillators for the Side-MRD modules were assembled at INR in Russia, and shipped to Japan in July 2017. 
The light yield for each scintillator was measured with cosmic rays at INR and at YNU in Japan after delivery.  
$LY_{1}$ and $LY_{2}$ are light yields measured at both ends of the counter.
The light yield asymmetry between the ends calculated as $100\% \times \frac{LY_{1}-LY_{2}}{LY_{1}+LY_{2}}$.
After tests at INR we selected 324 counters from measured 332 ones with the mean light yield of 45 p.e./MIP ( $LY_{1}$+ $LY_{2}$ ) and the asymmetry value less than 10 \% . 
The measuremens at YNU yielded the average total light yield of about 40 p.e./MIP which varies in range  from 32 to 50 p.e/MIP  (Figure \ref{fig:side_mrd_ly} (left)). 
Only two counters  showed relatively high asymmetry close to 25 \% as shown in Figure \ref{fig:side_mrd_ly} (right). 
Using the results of the quality assurance test  we selected 320 scintillator counters for the Side-MRD modules. 

We also measured the time resolution for a combination of four counters piled one upon another.
%Time resolution for a single counter is determined as rms of $(T_{left}-T{right})/2$ distribution. The difference of times was chosen to remove the correlated time fluctuation caused by a start trigger signal.
The average result for four counters is  $\sigma_T$ = 1.04~ns. %(Upper left plot in Fig. \ref{fig:side_mrd_combi_time}). 
%For a set of $n$ counters the time resolution is calculated as $\frac{(T_{L}-T_{R})_{1}+(T_{L}-T_{R})_{2}+...+(T_{L}-T_{R})_{n}}{2 \times n}$. The result of combination of 2, 3, 4 counters is 0.79~ns, 0.66~ns and 0.58~ns, correspondently (Fig. \ref{fig:side_mrd_combi_time}).
The resolution of combination of 2, 3, 4 counters is measured to be 0.79~ns, 0.66~ns and 0.58~ns, respectively.

Construction of the Side-MRD modules is scheduled from November 2017 
% to January 2018
at Yokohama National University. 
They will then be transported to J-PARC for installation on the B2 floor of the T2K near detector hall. 
%before T2K beam in March 2018.


Same electronics as the WAGASCI modules (see Sec. \ref{sec:wagasci_elec}) are used for the Side-MRD modules.
