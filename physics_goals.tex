\section{Physics goals}
We will measure the differential cross section for the charged current interaction on $\mathrm{H_2O}$ and/or CH.
The water-scntillator mass ratio of the Wagasci module is as high as 5:1 and the high purity measurement
of the cross section on $\mathrm{H_2O}$ is possible.
\textcolor{red}{One experimental option is to replace one of the two Wagasci module with the T2K proton module
  which is fully made with plastic scintillators. It will allow the precise comparison
  of cross section between $\mathrm{H_2O}$ and CH and also comparison of cross sections with ND280.}
  \textcolor{red}{Another option is to remove water from one of the two Wagasci module. 
The water-out WAGASCI module will make it possible to measure wider- angle scatterings for CH target and lower the detection threshold for proton tracks.
The water-out WAGASCI data also can be used to subtract the background from interaction with scintillators in the water target measurement .

Our setup would allow the measuemrents of inclusive and also exclusive channles such as
1-$\mu$, 1-$\mu 1p$, 1-$\mu 1\pi{\pm} np$ samples, former two of which are mainly caused by the quasi-elastic and
2p2h interaction and the latter is mainly caused by resonant or coherent pion production and deep elastic scattering.
In general, an accelerator produced neutrino beam spectrum is wide and the energy reconstruction
somehow rely on the neutrino interaction model.
Therefore, recent neutrino cross section measurement results including T2K are given as a flux-integrated cross section
rather than cross sections as a function of the neutrino energy to avoid the model dependency.
We can provide the flux-averaged cross section.
In addition, by combining our measurements with those at ND280, model-independent extraction of the cross section
for narrow energy region becomes possible.
This method was demonstrated in \ref{ingrid_energy_dependent} and also proposed by P** (NUPRISM).

\subsection{Expected number of events}
Expected number of neutrino events after the event selections is evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations as we will discuss in Section \ref{sec:mc_study}.
$2.41 \times 10^{4}$ CC events are expected in two WAGASCI modules after the selection with $1\times 10^{20}$ POT in neutrino-mode, and its purity is 75.5 \%.
In case we choose the option with one WAGASCI module and the T2K proton module,  $1.2 \times 10^{4}$ CC events are expected in the WAGASCI module and ? CC events are expected in the T2K proton module.
In case we choose the option with one water-in WAGASCI module and one water-out WAGASCI module,  $1.2 \times 10^{4}$ CC events are expected in the water-in module and $0.24 \times 10^{4}$ CC events are expected in the water-out module.
