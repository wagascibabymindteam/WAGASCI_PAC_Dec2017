\section{Physics goals}
We will measure the differential cross section for the charged current interaction on $\mathrm{H_2O}$ and/or CH.
The water-scntillator mass ratio of the Wagasci module is as high as 5:1 and the high purity measurement
of the cross section on $\mathrm{H_2O}$ is possible.
\textcolor{red}{One experimental option is to replace one of the two Wagasci module with the T2K proton module
  which is fully made with plastic scintillators. It will alow the precise comparison
  of cross section between $\mathrm{H_2O}$ and CH and also comparison of cross sections with ND280}
Our setup would allow the measuemrents of inclusive and also exclusive channles such as
1-$\mu$, 1-$\mu 1p$, 1-$\mu 1\pi{\pm} np$ samples, former two of which are mainly caused by the quasi-elastic and
2p2h interaction and the latter is mainly caused by resonant or coherent pion production and deep elastic scattering.
In general, an accelerator produced neutrino beam spectrum is wide and the energy reconstruction
somehow rely on the neutrino interaction model.
Therefore, recent neutrino cross section measurement results including T2K are given as a flux-integrated cross section
rather than cross sections as a function of the neutrino energy to avoid the model dependency.
We can provide the flux-averaged cross section.
In addition, by combining our measurements with those at ND280, model-independent extraction of the cross section
for narrow energy region becomes possible.
This method was demonstrated in \ref{ingrid_energy_dependent} and also proposed by P** (NUPRISM).
\textcolor{red}{add Yasutome plot here or later.}


\subsection{Expected number of events}
Expected number of neutrino events after the event selections is evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations as we will discuss further in Section \ref{sec:mc_study}.
$2.41 \times 10^{4}$ CC events are expected in two WAGASCI modules with $1\times 10^{20}$ POT in neutrino-mode, and its purity is 75.5 \% as shown in Table \ref{tab:expected_num_events_neutrino_beam}.
