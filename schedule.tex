\section{Schedule}
We would like to start a physics data taking from T2K beam time after the summer shutdown in 2018.
By then, commissioning and tests of the detectors will be completed in J-PARC T59.
The experiment can run parasitically with T2K, therefore we request no dedicated beam time nor beam condition as discussed in the following section.





Once the approved POT is accumulated, the WAGASCI modules will be removed from the experimental site, but we would like to keep the Baby-MIND and the Side-MRD modules on the B2 floor of the NM pit as common platforms of future neutrino experiments using the T2K neutrino beam.
