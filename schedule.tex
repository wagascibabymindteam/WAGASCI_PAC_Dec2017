\section{Schedule}
We would like to start physics data-taking with T2K beam after the summer shutdown in 2018.
By then, commissioning and tests of the detectors will be completed in J-PARC T59.
The experiment can run parasitically with T2K, therefore we request no dedicated beam time nor beam conditions as discussed in the following section.

%Once the approved POT is accumulated, the WAGASCI modules will be removed from the experimental site, but we would like to keep the Baby-MIND and the Side-MRD modules on the B2 floor of the NM pit as common platforms of future neutrino experiments using the T2K neutrino beam.
