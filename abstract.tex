We propose to study the neutrino-nucleus interaction around 1 GeV at the B2 floor of the T2K neutrino monitor building.
Our experimental setup contains two hollow cuboid lattice detectors as the neutrino interaction target (known as WAGASCI modules), two side- and one downstream- muon range detectors(MRDâ€™s).
The downstream-MRD, so called the Baby MIND detector, also works as a magnet and provides the charge identification capability.
Most of the detectors have already been constructed and have been commissioned in the J-PARC T59 experiment and the CERN neutrino platform.
Therefore, the collaboration will be ready to proceed to the physics data taking for the T2K beam time in January 2019.


We will provide the differential cross sections of the charged current neutrino and antineutrino interactions on water and hydrocarbon with slightly higher neutrino energy than T2K ND280 with wide angler acceptance.
In addition, by combining our measurements with those from ND280, model-independent extraction of the cross section for narrow energy spread becomes possible.
These measurements would greatly improve the understanding of the neutrino interaction at around 1 GeV and contribute to reducing one of the most significant uncertainties of the T2K experiment.
