\subsection{Baby MIND}
The Baby MIND construction was completed in June 2017, and it was then tested in June and July 2017 at the Proton Synchrotron experimental hall at CERN with a mixed particle beam comprising mostly muons whose momenta could be selected between 0.5 and 5 GeV/c. An event display from the summer 2017 tests is shown in Figure \ref{beam_vs_cosmic}.

All counters were measured at INR Moscow with a cosmic ray setup using the same type S12571-025C MPPCs and CAEN DT5742 digitizer \cite{Antonova:2017cdw}. The average light yield (sum from both ends) was measured to be 37.5 photo-electrons (p.e.) per minimum ionizing particle (MIP) and 65 p.e./MIP for vertical and horizontal counters, respectively. After shipment to CERN, all counters were tested once more individually with an LED test setup \cite{led_test_system}. 0.1\% of counters failed the LED tests and were therefore not used during the assembly of modules.
